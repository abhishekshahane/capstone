Idea: A website that gets the city where the user is, and displays the forecast of the city that is closest to the user(where it is snowing). It also displays cities where it will be snowing in the next 7 days in order of distance.


The point of this whole website is that people in places like where I live may have never seen snow in their lives or in a really long time and often, seeing snow for the first time can just be magical. Therefore, this website serves the purpose of maybe finding places that you can drive to where you can find snow. This isn't a particularly complex project, just a fun little idea. It requires an extensive use of APIs, which I have learned to work with in the course. 



This could be changed in the future, but for now, this is what I'll be building off of.
